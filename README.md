# BreizEl
BreizEl is a python script that computes the growth rates for electrostatic plasma instabilities in ultrarelativistic beams according to the Breizmann approximation.
The current version uses a Gaussian-like input distribution and a beam Lorentz factor of 100. These inputs and parameters can be manipulated.
